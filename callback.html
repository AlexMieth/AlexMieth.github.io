      Click into the address bar above and copy everything after "code=" and then close this browser window.

      It should look something like 
      <br/> 
      <br/>https://alexmieth.github.io/callback?code=1a2_b3c4d5e4f-5G
      <br/>
      <br/>in which case you would need to copy 1a2_b3c4d5e4f-5G. Your code will be much longer than this.

      Sorry this process is kind of annoying. I wanted to have the code just appear in this webpage and 
      be copied with one click, but GitHub won't allow for dynamic webpages. Although you probably don't care about
      any of that anyway.
